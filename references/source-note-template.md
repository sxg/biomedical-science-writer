## Example Completed Note

# Ma et al., 2013

**Citation**: Ma D, Gulani V, Seiberlich N, et al. Magnetic resonance fingerprinting. Nature. 2013;495(7440):187-192. doi:10.1038/nature11971

**PMID**: 23486058
**DOI**: 10.1038/nature11971
**Type**: Original Research

## Key Claims

1. MR fingerprinting can simultaneously quantify multiple tissue properties from a single acquisition
2. The technique is inherently robust to motion and system imperfections
3. Dictionary matching enables parameter quantification without explicit model fitting

## Methods Summary

Proof-of-concept study in phantoms and healthy volunteers demonstrating simultaneous T1 and T2 mapping using pseudorandom acquisition patterns matched to a precomputed dictionary.

- Study design: Technical development with phantom/volunteer validation
- Sample size: n = 5 volunteers
- Key technique: FISP-based MRF with spiral readout

## Key Results

- T1/T2 values within 5% of gold standard in phantoms
- Acquisition time: 12 seconds per slice
- Robust to B0/B1 inhomogeneity

## Relevance to Current Study

**Relationship**: Provides Context (foundational paper)

This is the seminal MRF paper that established the technique we are building upon. Our study extends this approach to 7T with optimized sequences for brain tumor characterization. Cite in Introduction as foundational reference.

## Quotable Phrases

- "a new approach to data acquisition, post-processing and visualization" (p. 187)

## For Discussion Section

**Use this source to:**
- [x] Provide context for MRF technique background
- [ ] Support our finding that...
- [ ] Contrast with our finding because...
- [ ] Explain mechanism of...
