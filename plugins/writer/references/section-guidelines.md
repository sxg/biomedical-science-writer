# Scientific Writing Section Guidelines

Quick reference for conventions in each manuscript section.

## Title

- Concise: 10-15 words maximum
- Informative: convey main finding or scope
- Avoid: abbreviations, questions, "A study of..."
- Good: "Deep Learning Model Outperforms Traditional Methods for Time Series Prediction"
- Bad: "A Study Investigating the Use of Machine Learning for Data Analysis"

## Abstract

| Component | Length | Content |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Background | 2-3 sentences | Gap and objective |
| Methods | 3-4 sentences | Design, population, analysis |
| Results | 3-4 sentences | Key findings with numbers |
| Conclusion | 1-2 sentences | Takeaway and implication |

Total: 250-300 words (check journal requirements)

## Introduction

| Paragraph | Purpose | Tense |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Broad context/significance | Present |
| 2 | Current state of knowledge | Present/Past |
| 3 | Gap or limitation | Present |
| 4 | Study purpose | Past (our study) |

- End with clear objective statement
- ~500-800 words
- Cite every factual claim

## Methods

### Subsection Order
1. Study Design and Population
2. Data Acquisition (if applicable)
3. Data Processing/Preprocessing
4. Statistical Analysis
5. Software/Tools

### Key Conventions
- Past tense, passive voice
- Specific parameters (not "standard protocol")
- Reproducibility: enough detail to replicate
- Ethics statement if applicable (human subjects, animals, etc.)
- Software versions

### Common Phrases
- "Data were analyzed using..."
- "Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05"
- "The study was approved by [ethics board/IRB/IACUC]"
- "[N] patients were excluded due to..."

## Results

### Structure
1. Study population/demographics (always first)
2. Primary outcome
3. Secondary outcomes
4. Subgroup analyses

### Key Conventions
- Past tense
- Lead with finding, then statistics
- No interpretation (save for Discussion)
- Reference all figures/tables

### Statistical Reporting
- P-values: p = 0.043 or p < 0.001
- CI: (95% CI: 1.2–3.4) — use en-dash
- Mean ± SD for normal data
- Median (IQR) for skewed data
- n (%) for categorical

## Discussion

### Paragraph Structure
1. Principal findings (interpret main result)
2-3. Comparison with literature
4. Mechanistic interpretation
5. Practical implications
6. Limitations
7. Future directions

### Key Conventions
- Present tense for general truths
- Past tense for your findings
- Hedging matches evidence strength
- No new data (that belongs in Results)

### Limitation Framing
Bad: "Our study has several limitations."
Good: "While [limitation], [mitigating factor]..."

## Conclusion

- 1 paragraph, 3-5 sentences
- Restate main finding
- State significance
- Suggest implication
- No new information
- No citations

## References

- Check journal style (Vancouver, AMA, etc.)
- Number in order of appearance
- Include DOI when available
- Verify all citations are in reference list
- Verify all references are cited in text
